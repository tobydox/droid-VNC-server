# droid-vnc-server

This repo forked from https://github.com/appknox/droid-VNC-server

The differences with the upstream repo are:

1. Migrated to Android Studio 3 / Gradle 4.1
2. Added handling for mouse wheel, in vnc server binary
3. Compiled for API 25, flinger library only

This was made for a custom LineageOS rom for particular device (for Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 / mido) with droidVNC app preinstalled, so I didn't need to support other Android devices. It may work, or not work, for your case.

If you need droidVNC port/customization for your device, or any custom Android ROM / firmware - feel you free to contact me at gmixaz at gmail com. My profile at upwork: https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~015014cada179b4e70/
